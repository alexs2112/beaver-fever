Welcome to Beaver Fever! In this game you are an aggressive beaver whose only desire is to enter the Local Jim Hortons. The objective of the game is to earn enough money ($500) to buy your large double-double! However, beware of the hockey players and Canadian Geese who are out to get you! They can damage you and you can damage them. To regain your health you can have a meal that consists of bacon, maple syrup and poutine which you will find as you explore the game. Enjoy!
